# Reflect

Reflect is an application that simplifies journaling and recording your everyday thoughts and emotions you may have througout the day,week, and to a year. It can help you start your day right by asking you a couple of questions:

1. How are you feeling today? Happy, sad, or bad?
2. What is your Reflection about? Past, present, future?
3. What are your thoughts? 

## Objective
Reflect’s goal is to make your job easier by helping you keep track of your mental health, well-being, and increase your self-awareness. You will create an account so you can start logging your day right away.

## Features
Reflect will ask you questions like “How are you feeling today?” and followed by a journal section where you can write it all down. 

Once your entries have been logged it will be stored in a database and be shown in a pie chart, which will visually show your moods, thoughts, and habits in percentages. 

## Why is journaling important?
Nowadays, writing in a journal can be hard and be overwhelming. However, implementing a journal is proven to help. University of Rochester Medical Center states that journaling can:
 > “manage anxiety, reduce stress, and cope with depression. Journaling helps control your symptoms and improve your mood by helping you prioritize problems, fears, and concerns tracking any symptoms day-to-day so that you can recognize triggers and learn ways to better control them providing an opportunity for positive self-talk and identifying negative thoughts and behaviors.”

We hope that you may achieve a healthy mind and heart with the help of Reflect.
